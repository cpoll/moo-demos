# How to run:
- `cd` into this folder
- run `python3 -m http.server`
    - This will create an ad-hoc webserver in the folder where it's run. The webserver will serve files from the folder and child folders.
- In your browser, visit `localhost:8000/index.html`
    - localhost:8000 (port 8000) is the default location for the Python3 HTTP server. localhost:8000/index.html is the index.html file in this folder.
